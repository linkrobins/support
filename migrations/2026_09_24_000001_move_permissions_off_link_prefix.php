 * contains "view" as one of its own link permissions and reads a link id out
 * of the name. "linkrobins-support.handle_tickets" and its siblings therefore became link
 * ids on any forum running both extensions: MySQL cast the nonsense id to 0
 * silently, PostgreSQL rejects the query and every page fails. Only the key
 * changes — every group keeps exactly the grants it had, and the migration
 * is safe to run twice.
